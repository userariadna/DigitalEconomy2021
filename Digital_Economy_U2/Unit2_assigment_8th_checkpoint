The presence of digital age is consuming our time increasingly, we pay more attention to new media trends on digital platforms, by nature we tend to keep abreast on the hot-new
topics on this day by day globalized world, the scale of digital-media growing up is huge, a big and important part of this digital consumption of media from us 
is not being taken into account by economic indicators such as the GDP, that is simply because GDP only bases its estimations on monetary spend of consumption
people do on digital platforms but not on how much they benefit from those. The thing with GDP is that it does not measure the amount of satisfaction reflected 
in productivity gain got from a purchased service, it only computes the monetary revenue of the final goods produced in the economy. Fortunately a new economic
strategy at least theoretically promises to cover this  gap. Consumer surplus is the name of the metric which would calculate the consumer well-being and it is
computed by the subtraction between the maximum a consumer would be willing to spend and its price. A good example of how GDP can be a misleading proxy for 
economic well-being is the case of Encyclopedia Britannica and Wikipedia, while the first one used to cost several thousand dollars with less articles, 
Wikipedia had a total cost of $0 and although it has around $150 income per user a year, this is translated into about $42 billion in surplus for consumer which 
is not reflected in the U.S. GDP. Expenditures of customers (the foundation for GDP) can be tracked at the cash register and reflected in financial statements.
Consumer surplus, on the other hand, cannot be immediately identified, which is one of the reasons it hasn't been widely utilized to measure the economy. 
In this aspect of digital economy AI can potentially play an important role, the automation of digitalized platforms will probably allow in the future to 
inlcude this way of calculating the level of satisfaction and therefore to have a better accurate production gain from all people consumers. 
One of the most concerned and frightening question of mankind related to Artificial Intelligence is that if IA will ever overcome the barrier of human 
understanding being even able to identify emotions, overcoming thus the reasoning of human knowledge  Max Tegmark recognized physicist from MIT proposes
two different groups the “techno-sceptics” who don’t think that a superior human capacity AI will emerge in the first century and the “digital utopians” 
who believe that within a few decades, a breakthrough from narrow AI, such as task-specific algorithms taught to address narrowly specified issues, 
to universal AI applications could hapen, benefiting humanity as a whole. Indeed, some members of this group visualize the rise of AI as the next reasonable stage in evolution,
where humans will increasingly augment and upgrade their abilities through technology, eventually merging physically with their machines, some argue that this is this
is already present in the everyday life; citing the smartphone as a powerful extension of our abilities to communicate, memorize, etc. When discussing the economic
implications of the digital revolution, particularly AI and robotics, it appears to be crucial to emphasize one issue right away: Continuous technical progress 
has been one of the key drivers of economic growth and wealth in the two hundred years since the spread of the steam engine, providing us with (exponentially) 
increased power (energy), productive means, mobility, and organization/communication. A important concern is whether artificial intelligence will be able to 
overcome the recent slowdown in productivity development, and, if so, how workers would fit into such a situation. In recent years Big Data has arisen as a 
new paradigm for digital earth applications such as science, business, and engineering, offering plentiful data and chances to enhance and/or allow research
and decision-building applications with unparalleled value. Big Data, on the other hand, poses issues for digital earth in terms of storing, transporting, 
processing, mining, and serving data. The application of these resources has generated amazing Big Data breakthroughs, and cloud computing provides key 
assistance to meet the difficulties using shared computing resources such as computation, storage, networking, and analytical software. Data handling has
changed from a more traditional static mode to an accelerating data arena characterized by volume, velocity, variety, veracity, and value as a result of
technological advancements and human comprehension of data. The first V stands for the volume of data, which is rapidly increasing and exceeding our ability 
to manage massive data sets. The term "velocity" alludes to the rapid generation and transfer of data through the Internet, as seen by data collecting from 
social networks and a huge array of sensors from microcontrollers (atomic),  "variety" means to the various data formats and in which model and structural 
data are stored. "Veracity" refers to the range of data quality, precision, and reliability. The fifth V, which focuses on specialized research and decision-support 
applications that improve our lives, work, and prosperity, requires all four Vs. The unification of cloud computing, Big Data, and the economy of commodities 
and digital services has sparked interest in IT-related services, which account for a significant portion of our everyday shopping consumption. Blockchain technology 
is a decentralized, distributed ledger system that promotes data integrity and transparency. In a nutshell, block chain is a collection of blocks connected in a chain-like
pattern. All of the blocks in this section will be linked to the block before it and the block before it. Furthermore, every block in that chain stores data, and the chain
reflects the linking architecture. In actuality, cryptography will be used to connect every single block. Furthermore, along with transactional data and timestamps, 
every block in that chain will contain a cryptographic hash ID. And ending up with a growing chain of blocks, that is what blockchain actually is.
It can be thought of as a database that saves information in a unique manner. However, despite the fact that they both store data, blockchain and databases are 
fundamentally different. Blockchain technology, by default, does not allow for data alteration. As a result, any data placed in the block cannot be erased or changed. 
As a result, it will remain there indefinitely. Another important point to know about blockchain technology is that it is a peer-to-peer network. Blockchain technology
has the potential to revolutionize our  current system of economy and society's digital interactions. Startups and incumbents alike drive the technology's rapid and dynamic 
technical development, resulting in a wide range of applications across economic and societal areas. However, the economic and societal consequences of this prospective
new technology paradigm have not yet been thoroughly investigated, nor have the implications of this potential new technological paradigm reached a larger public discourse.
Hyperledger Foundation contains a great number of enterprise-grade blockchain software projects. Furtermore, Hyperladger allows create private blockchain, and also 
is not necessary mining or releasing tokens, another thing is that the transactions can be meade confidential, only accesible to users with the necessary decryption keys.
The hyperladger constains a set for a permission usser as well as the ledger. Some examples are Hyperladger IROHA, Hyperladger INDY, Hyperlager BURROW.In addition, 
Hyperladger was created and led by ibm, and also is part of a larger Linux Foundation team that has years of experience in providing program management services
for open source projects.A financial transaction is an agreement, or communication, carried out between a buyer and a seller to exchange an asset for payment.
It involves a change in the status of the finances of two or more businesses or individuals. The buyer and seller are separate entities or objects, often involving the exchange of items of value, such as information, goods, services, and money. 
It is still a transaction if the goods are exchanged at one time, and the money at another. 






















In order to understand the following concepts, it is important to note that digital currency is known by various names, such as digital money, electronic money, electronic currency or cyber money. This concept is a form of currency that is available only in digital or electronic form. On the other hand, it is important to highligh that digital currency is also used to transfer value, in order to get it, there is necessary a very good mental shift talking about the existing framework for currencies. There are  three different types of currencies most important which are knows as : 1) Cryptocurrencies ( cryptography currencies used to secure and verify transactions in a network);  2) Visual Currencies (They can be algorithmicallly managed by a network protocol, that is, they are unregulated controlled by developers or a founding organization consisting of various stakeholders involved in the process); 3) Central Bank Digital Currencies (they can be a replacement to traditional fiat currency; they are regulated digital currencies issued by the central bank of a country). Also but not less important, the have a lot of advantages that are relevant to mention: They can ease implementation of monetary and fiscal policy , They do not require physical manufacturing and cannot be soiled, they can make transaction costs cheaper, they have fast transfer and transaction times. But also there are some dissadvantages, for example: They can be volatile in value because sometimes they are  susceptible to hacking and even they do not solve all storage and infrastructure problems. 

Across the time, there has been appearing many obstacles or challenges about this concept, that means that realities as bitcoin could fail in a close future, there are thousands of cryptocurrencies and bitcoin is just one of them.  Spending Bitcoin is still a bigger problem than hoarding it; there are many real cases of ilegal transactions paying with this kind of money: that is in 2013, a crypto enthusiast paid bitcoin for a Costa Mesa luxury car dealership for a Tesla Model S. It was a legally authorized deal, the payout was just under 92 bitcoins that were worth over $ 100,000 at the time. However, the real-time value of cryptocurrencies is versatile, since the value changes constantly less (leading to very large gains or losses as it was in this case). In conclusion: the real-time losses that have occurred due to Bitcoin transactions over the years cannot be overcome. 

QUESTIONS(Ulises Mis)

1. Why can GDP sometimes be considered as an inaccurate estimator of well-being of economics?
Because GDP only bases its estimations on monetary spend of consumption people do on digital platforms but not on how much they benefit from those,  GDP itself does not measure the amount of satisfaction reflected in productivity gain got from a purchased service.

2. How is customer surplus measured? Provide an example
Customer surplus is computed by the difference on how much a consumer would be willing to spend at most and its actual price, For example, users pay $120 to $240 a year for video-streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, and HBO en up having the consumer surplus generated from those services is
five to 10 times what users pay to access them.

3. What is the difference between consumer surplus and customer expenditures?
Expenditures of customers (the foundation for GDP) can be tracked at the cash register and reflected in financial statements while consumer surplus cannot be immediately identified.

4. How do techno-sceptics differ from digital utopians?
Techno-sceptics don’t think that AI that exceeds human capacity will emerge at least in the next 100 years while  digital utopians think that the revolution of thinking machine is nearly approaching, they expect this by considering that noways well-trained algorithms of machine learning facilitate our lives.

5. How does AI affect the next step in evolution?
Humans will probably increase the amount of work therefore augmenting with constant upgrade their abilities through technology, eventually merging physically with their machines.

6. What are the economic implications of the digital revolution, in AI and robotics?
Continuous technical progress that has been one of the key drivers of economic growth and wealth in the two hundred years since the spread of the steam engine, providing us with (exponentially) increased power (energy)


7. What does Big Data provide on the digital earth applications and what problems it presents?
It offers plentiful data and chances to enhance and/or allow research and decision-building applications with unparalleled value. At the same time and unfortunately Big Data poses issues for digital earth in terms of storing, transporting, processing, mining, and serving data. 

8. How cloud computing is involved in this phase?
Cloud computing provides key assistance to meet the difficulties using shared computing resources such as computation, storage, networking, and analytical software. 

9. Why has data handling changed?
Data handling has changed from a more traditional static mode to an accelerating data arena because it needs to be characterized by volume, velocity, variety, veracity, and value as a result of technological advancements and human comprehension of data. 


10. How can blockchain be interpreted?
Block chain can be seen as a collection of blocks connected in a chain-like pattern. All of the blocks in this section will be linked to the block before it and the block before it. Furthermore, every block in that chain stores data, and the chain reflects the linking architecture. 

11. Why can databases be compared with blockchain and why do they differ?
Blockchain can be thought of as a database that saves information in a unique manner. However, despite the fact that they both store data, blockchain and databases are fundamentally different. Blockchain technology, by default, does not allow for data alteration. As a result, any data placed in the block cannot be erased or changed. 

12. How are startups and incumbents involving in blockchain?
They alike drive the technology's rapid and dynamic technical development, resulting in a wide range of applications across economic and societal areas.

It is also known as digital money, electronic money, electronic currency or cyber money

15. Please, mention 1 disadvantage and 1 advantage about digital currencies:
One of the most important desadvantages is that they can be volatile in value because sometimes they are  susceptible to hacking. But on the other hand, they have fast transfer and transaction times than a physical one.

16. From your opinion, do u consiter that is dangerous to use bitcoin for paying in real life?

Answer can vary, but mainly it is refered to: every risk has its pros and cons,aAs investments, this type of investment can be advantageous for some, however, when paying or making legal deals with someone it is important to make expensive accounts with real physical money, or colloquial money transaction. Due to the fact that this type of payments, as in bitcoin, is in constant change and there may be significant losses leading to illegal problems. 

17. According to the text, what is the main problem observed over time with transactions like bitcoin? 
Answer can vary, but mainly it is refered to: the real-time losses that have occurred due to Bitcoin transactions over the years cannot be overcome.
